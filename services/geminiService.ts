🎨 MULTI-PANEL INSTRUCTION FORMAT (2-4 PANELS PER IMAGE):
The image MUST be divided into 2-4 clear panels showing detailed sub-steps:

PANEL LAYOUT OPTIONS:
OPTION 1 (4 panels for complex steps):
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   PANEL 1   │   PANEL 2   │
│  CUTOUTS    │  ASSEMBLY   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│   PANEL 3   │   PANEL 4   │
│ ADD DETAILS │  FINISHED   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘

OPTION 2 (2-3 panels for simpler steps):
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   PANEL 1   │   PANEL 2   │
│  PREPARE    │  ASSEMBLE   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘

PANEL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

PANEL 1 - COMPLETE PATTERN SHEETS (FLAT KNOLLING LAYOUT):
🎯 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PANEL - FULL BUILDABLE 3D PATTERN TEMPLATES:
- Show COMPLETE, FULL-DETAIL pattern sheets that can be printed and used to build the craft
- These must be ACTUAL TEMPLATES, not sketches or simplified versions
- Layout: ALL sheets laid FLAT side-by-side in organized knolling arrangement (NEVER stacked)
- View: Perfect top-down view as if looking at sheets on a cutting mat with grid background

🚨 CRITICAL PATTERN TYPE DETECTION:
There are TWO types of papercraft patterns - choose the appropriate type based on the reference image:

TYPE 1 - 3D FOLDED PAPERCRAFT (for objects with curved/dimensional forms):
✓ Patterns must be properly UNWRAPPED like UV maps in 3D modeling
✓ ROUNDED/CURVED shapes (heads, bodies, limbs) unwrap into flattened geometric patterns
✓ A spherical head unwraps into petal-like segments or gores (like a globe map)
✓ A cylindrical body unwraps into a curved rectangle that wraps around to form a tube
✓ Curved limbs unwrap into elongated shapes with proper curvature to fold into 3D tubes
✓ Fold lines (dashed) show where the flat pattern folds to create the 3D form
✓ The unwrapped pattern geometry must be mathematically correct to assemble into the 3D shape

🚨 CRITICAL MATERIAL REQUIREMENT - PAPER ONLY (100% PAPER):
✓ EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT must be made from PAPER - no foam, fabric, wire, pipe cleaners, clay, terracotta, or soft materials
✓ Use LOW-POLY STYLE geometric folding for curved shapes (like origami/low-poly 3D models)
✓ Curves are achieved through strategic folds and facets, NOT soft rounded materials
✓ Example: A round mouth/lips should be angular paper facets that create the illusion of curves
✓ Stems/supports = rolled paper tubes, NOT pipe cleaners or wire
✓ Pots/containers = folded/rolled paper, NOT clay or terracotta
✓ Base filler = paper strips or crumpled paper, NOT fabric or fuzzy material
✓ Use paper thickness and layering to create depth, NOT soft padding materials
✓ This is PURE PAPERCRAFT - 100% paper construction, everything folds/rolls from flat paper sheets

TYPE 2 - 2D LAYERED PAPERCRAFT (for flat shapes with stacked layers):
✓ Patterns are flat 2D shapes that stack on top of each other
✓ Multiple layers create depth and "body" through thickness
✓ Each layer is a complete flat outline (no folding required)
✓ Layers are glued/stacked to build up dimension (like a 3D relief)
✓ Show ALL layers separately: base layer, middle layers, detail layers, top layer
✓ Each layer should be clearly labeled (Layer 1, Layer 2, etc.) with thickness indication
✓ Layers may be slightly offset or sized differently to create contours

EACH PATTERN SHEET MUST INCLUDE (based on type):
FOR 3D FOLDED PAPERCRAFT:
✓ Complete outlines with proper 3D unwrapping geometry
✓ Cut lines (solid black lines) showing where to cut
✓ Fold lines (dashed lines) showing where the flat pattern folds to create 3D curves
✓ Glue tabs clearly marked (small flaps extending from edges for assembly)
✓ Piece labels/numbers (1, 2, 3, A, B, C) on each component
✓ Small assembly arrows or symbols showing how pieces connect

FOR 2D LAYERED PAPERCRAFT:
✓ Complete flat outlines for EACH layer (no fold lines needed)
✓ Cut lines (solid black lines) showing where to cut
✓ Layer numbers clearly marked (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, etc.)
✓ Indication of stacking order or which side faces up
✓ Small registration marks showing how layers align
✓ Optional: foam spacer indicators between layers for extra depth

BOTH TYPES:
✓ Scale indicators or measurements for size reference
✓ Colors matching EXACT colors from Reference craft object

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- MAXIMUM PRECISION: Lines must be clean, clear, and accurate
- Colors: Match EXACT colors from the Reference craft object
- Background: White paper with subtle grid lines (like cutting mat)
- Spacing: Sheets arranged neatly with small gaps between them
- Text label at top: "PATTERN SHEETS" or "TEMPLATES"

CRITICAL: Someone should be able to print Panel 1, cut out the pieces, and successfully assemble them into the craft matching the reference image. The patterns must be geometrically correct for the appropriate type (3D folded OR 2D layered).

PANEL 2 - ASSEMBLY PROCESS:
- Show hands/fingers actively assembling pieces
- Use LARGE BOLD ARROWS (→ ➜ ⬇) showing direction of movement
- Add text annotations explaining what to do: "FOLD HERE", "GLUE TAB", "ALIGN EDGES"
- Show partially assembled state
- Include small numbered steps (①②③) if multiple actions
- Add text label: "ASSEMBLY" or "HOW TO ATTACH"

PANEL 3 - ADD DETAILS (if 4-panel layout):
- Show hands adding decorative elements, layers, or final pieces
- Use arrows pointing to where details should be placed
- Show close-up of attachment points
- Include text: "ADD LAYER", "ATTACH HERE", "GLUE POINT"
- Add text label: "DETAILS" or "FINAL TOUCHES"

PANEL 4 - FINISHED COMPONENT (if 4-panel layout):
- Show the completed component from this step
- Display from best viewing angle
- Include scale reference if needed
- Show how it looks when properly assembled
- Add text label: "FINISHED" or "RESULT"

🚨 CRITICAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Each panel MUST have a clear label/heading at the top
✓ Use BOLD ARROWS (not thin lines) showing movement/direction
✓ Add TEXT ANNOTATIONS explaining actions ("fold", "glue", "attach", "align")
✓ Show HANDS/FINGERS in assembly panels to demonstrate technique
✓ Use WHITE BACKGROUND with subtle grid lines (like blueprint paper)
✓ EXACT color matching from Reference Image
✓ Clear visual separation between panels (thin border lines)
✓ NO ELECTRONIC PARTS - only handcraft materials (paper, glue, scissors)

EXAMPLE WITH ANALYSIS - Piranha Plant - Step: "Create and Pot the Plants":
ANALYSIS FIRST:
- Pot: 3D cylinder → unwrap into curved rectangle with base circle
- Needs: Base stability (reinforced bottom), connection tabs for stems
- Surface: Brown paper texture, simple geometric form
THEN CREATE:
Panel 1: Pattern sheets showing pot unwrapped cylinder + circular base + small support tabs for stem insertion points
Panel 2: Hands rolling cylinder and gluing seam, text "FORM CYLINDER"
Panel 3: Hands attaching base circle to bottom of cylinder, arrows showing tab fold
Panel 4: Completed pot with stem holes visible at top

EXAMPLE WITH ANALYSIS - Piranha Plant - Step: "Assemble Stems and Leaves":
ANALYSIS FIRST:
- Stems: Long thin tubes → need internal paper support (rolled tight paper rod inside)
- Leaves: Flat shapes with slight curve → simple cutouts with subtle center fold for 3D effect
- Connection: Stems insert into pot holes, leaves attach to stem sides
THEN CREATE:
Panel 1: Pattern sheets showing ONLY stem rectangles (for rolling), inner support strips, leaf shapes - laid flat
Panel 2: Hands rolling stem around inner support tube, text "ROLL TIGHTLY"
Panel 3: Hands folding leaf center line and gluing to stem, arrows showing attachment
Panel 4: Completed stem with leaves attached, ready to insert into pot

EXAMPLE WITH ANALYSIS - Character - Step: "Assemble body":
ANALYSIS FIRST:
- Body: Cylindrical torso → unwrap into curved rectangle
- Has: Rounded belly (slight curve in pattern), connection points top/bottom for head/legs
- Needs: Glue tabs on vertical seam, neck opening at top
THEN CREATE:
Panel 1: Pattern sheets showing ONLY BODY: torso unwrapped curved rectangle with belly curve, connection tabs - NO head, NO limbs shown
Panel 2: Hands folding body piece along dashed lines, arrows showing fold direction
Panel 3: Hands gluing body tabs to close cylinder, text "GLUE SEAM"
Panel 4: Completed body cylinder only - no other parts attached yet`,

🧠 BEFORE GENERATING PATTERNS - ANALYZE THE COMPONENT:
Ask yourself these questions about the component in "${stepDescription}":
1. **Is this a 3D or 2D structure?**
   - Does it have volume/depth (head, body, limbs, pot) = 3D → needs unwrapping
   - Is it flat with stacked layers (shield, badge, sign) = 2D → needs layer sheets

2. **If 3D - What is the base shape?**
   - Sphere/rounded (head, ball) → unwrap into petal gores like a globe
   - Cylinder (body, limbs, tube, pot) → unwrap into curved rectangle
   - Cone (hat, nose) → unwrap into pie-slice fan shape
   - Box (base, platform) → unwrap into cross/net with 6 faces
   - Complex organic → break into geometric segments and unwrap each

3. **Does it need structural support?**
   - Tall/thin parts (stems, legs, necks) → add internal rolled paper tubes for rigidity
   - Heavy parts (pot, base) → reinforce edges with doubled paper
   - Hanging parts (leaves, petals) → add small paper tabs for support

4. **How will it connect to other parts?**
   - Add glue tabs at connection points
   - Ensure tab placement allows proper assembly
   - Match connection size to adjacent component

5. **What's the surface detail?**
   - Spots/patterns → print directly on pattern sheet
   - Teeth/features → separate small pieces to glue on
   - Texture → indicate with fold lines or scored paper

ANALYZE THE REFERENCE IMAGE NOW and determine the answers to these questions before creating the pattern sheets.

🚨 CRITICAL SCOPE REQUIREMENT:
This step image must ONLY show components and actions mentioned in the step description: "${stepDescription}"
- If the step is "Assemble body", show ONLY body pieces (no head, no clothes, no hair, no accessories)
- If the step is "Attach head", show ONLY head pieces and neck connection (no body, no limbs)
- If the step is "Add clothing details", show ONLY clothing pieces being attached (no underlying body)
- DO NOT show components from other steps - stay strictly within this step's scope
- The panels should focus exclusively on the specific parts mentioned in this step

🎨 CRITICAL MULTI-PANEL REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST create an image divided into 2-4 clear panels showing sub-steps within this main step.

MANDATORY ELEMENTS IN YOUR IMAGE:
1️⃣ PANEL DIVISIONS: Clear visual separation between panels (thin border lines or spacing)
2️⃣ PANEL LABELS: Each panel MUST have a text heading at the top ("PATTERN SHEETS", "MATERIALS", "ASSEMBLE", "FINISHED", etc.)
3️⃣ BOLD ARROWS: Use large, clearly visible arrows (→ ➜ ⬇ ↑) showing movement, direction, or connections
4️⃣ TEXT ANNOTATIONS: Add instructional text explaining actions ("FOLD HERE", "GLUE TAB", "ATTACH HERE", "ALIGN EDGES")
5️⃣ HANDS/FINGERS: Show hands demonstrating techniques in assembly/process panels
6️⃣ DETAILED INFORMATION: Pack each panel with visual details - this should look like a professional craft instruction manual

🚨 SPECIAL REQUIREMENT FOR STEP 1 / PATTERN SHEETS PANEL:
FOR PAPERCRAFT CATEGORY - FIRST STEP IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Panel 1 is THE MOST CRITICAL - it must contain COMPLETE, PRECISE 3D pattern sheets for the selected craft object
- Show FULL pattern templates that someone could actually print and use to build this craft

🎯 CRITICAL PATTERN TYPE SELECTION:
Examine the reference image carefully to determine which type of papercraft this is:

TYPE 1 - 3D FOLDED PAPERCRAFT (if object has curved/rounded forms that need folding):
  * Patterns must be properly unwrapped like UV maps in 3D modeling
  * A ROUNDED HEAD unwraps into petal-like segments/gores (like peeling an orange)
  * A CYLINDRICAL BODY unwraps into a curved rectangle that wraps around to form a tube
  * CURVED LIMBS unwrap into elongated curved shapes with fold lines to create 3D tubes
  * SPHERICAL shapes unwrap into geometric patterns with strategic fold lines
  * Include dashed fold lines showing where to fold
  * The unwrapped geometry must be mathematically correct to fold into the 3D shape

  🚨 PAPER-ONLY REQUIREMENT:
  * ALL parts must be made from PAPER - no foam, fabric, wire, or soft materials
  * Use LOW-POLY GEOMETRIC STYLE for curves (like low-poly 3D models)
  * Curves created through angular paper facets and strategic folds, NOT soft materials
  * Example: Round lips/mouth = angular paper segments that approximate the curve
  * This is PURE PAPERCRAFT - everything constructed from flat paper with folds

TYPE 2 - 2D LAYERED PAPERCRAFT (if object uses flat stacked layers for depth):
  * Patterns are flat 2D shapes that stack on top of each other
  * Show MULTIPLE LAYERS separately (base, middle, detail, top layers)
  * Each layer is a complete flat outline with no fold lines
  * Layers stack vertically to create "body" and thickness
  * Label each layer clearly (Layer 1 - Base, Layer 2 - Middle, etc.)
  * Layers may be slightly different sizes/shapes to create contoured depth
  * Include small spacers or foam tape indicators between layers if needed

- Each pattern sheet must display:
  * Complete outlines with proper 3D unwrapping geometry (NOT just simple flat shapes)
  * Cut lines (solid) showing where to cut
  * Fold lines (dashed) showing where flat patterns fold to create 3D curves
  * Glue tabs where pieces connect (flaps extending from edges)
  * Piece numbers or labels (1, 2, 3, A, B, C, etc.)
  * Scale reference or measurements
- Layout: Spread ALL sheets FLAT side-by-side in knolling arrangement (NOT stacked)
- View: Top-down view as if sheets are laid on a cutting mat with grid background
- Detail level: MAXIMUM PRECISION - patterns must be accurate and buildable
- Colors: Match EXACT colors from the reference craft object
- Background: White with subtle grid lines (like blueprint/cutting mat paper)

CRITICAL: These are ACTUAL 3D-UNWRAPPED PATTERN TEMPLATES. Someone should be able to print, cut, score fold lines, and assemble into a 3D craft matching the reference image. The unwrapped geometry must be correct for 3D assembly.

🚨 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
❌ NO ELECTRONIC PARTS (no circuits, LEDs, batteries, wires, motors)
❌ NO POWER TOOLS visible in frame
❌ FOR PAPERCRAFT: NO FOAM, NO FABRIC, NO WIRE, NO SOFT MATERIALS - PAPER ONLY
❌ FOR PAPERCRAFT: NO smooth rounded curves - use LOW-POLY GEOMETRIC FACETS instead
✅ PAPERCRAFT must be PURE PAPER with angular/geometric folds (low-poly style)
✅ Simple hand tools are OK (scissors, glue - but focus on the craft, not the tools)

${categoryRules}

FINAL REMINDERS:
1. This MUST be a multi-panel image with labels, arrows, text annotations, and hands demonstrating the technique
2. Reference the original image's colors and style exactly
3. 🚨 MOST IMPORTANT: Show ONLY the components mentioned in this step: "${stepDescription}"
   - Do NOT include components from other steps
   - Focus strictly on the parts needed for THIS specific step
   - If the step is about the body, show ONLY body pieces (no head, limbs, clothes, etc.)
   - If the step is about attaching one part to another, show ONLY those two parts and their connection

    You are an expert maker. I have SELECTED A SPECIFIC SINGLE OBJECT from a larger craft project.

    CONTEXT IMAGE (Full Project): The second image shows the complete project for reference.
    TARGET OBJECT (What to Analyze): The first image shows ONLY ONE OBJECT I want instructions for: "${objectLabel}"

    🚨 CRITICAL SINGLE-OBJECT RULE 🚨
    - YOU MUST CREATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXACTLY ONE OBJECT: "${objectLabel}"
    - If you see multiple characters or objects in the images, create instructions ONLY for "${objectLabel}"
    - DO NOT create instructions for other characters, objects, accessories, or display elements
    - EXAMPLE: If the full image shows "Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf" and I selected "Link", create instructions ONLY for Link figure, NOT Zelda, NOT Ganondorf, NOT the shield, NOT the sword accessories
    - The first image may contain some background elements due to imperfect selection - IGNORE them
    - Focus EXCLUSIVELY on: "${objectLabel}"

    YOUR TASK: Create step-by-step instructions to build THIS ONE OBJECT ONLY: "${objectLabel}"

    1. Determine the complexity (Simple, Moderate, Complex) and a score 1-10 FOR "${objectLabel}" ONLY.
    2. List the essential materials needed FOR "${objectLabel}" ONLY.
    3. Break down the construction into logical steps FOR "${objectLabel}" ONLY.

    🚨 CRITICAL STEP COUNT AND CHARACTER LIMIT RULES 🚨
    - MAXIMUM 4 STEPS TOTAL - This is a hard limit!
    - MAXIMUM 2 CHARACTERS per craft (NOT counting props/accessories)
    - Props and accessories (swords, shields, hats, pots, stands, bases) DO NOT count toward character limit
    - If "${objectLabel}" contains more than 2 characters, intelligently select the 2 most important/iconic ones
    - Examples:
      * "Mario and Luigi" = 2 characters ✓ (allowed)
      * "Mario, Luigi, and Peach" = 3 characters ✗ (pick 2 most iconic: Mario + Luigi)
      * "Link with Master Sword and Shield" = 1 character + 2 props ✓ (allowed, props don't count)
      * "Piranha Plant in Pot with Stand" = 1 character + 2 props ✓ (allowed)

    STEP COUNT RULES:
    - Do NOT create a "gather materials" step - start with actual construction
    - Combine related substeps into single steps (e.g., "Cut and shape base pieces" instead of two steps)
    - Focus on MAJOR construction phases only, not every tiny detail
    - Each step should represent a significant milestone in the build
    - Focus ONLY on "${objectLabel}", ignore all other objects in both images

    EXAMPLE - Good step breakdown for a papercraft figure (4 steps):
    Step 1: Cut out all pattern pieces and score fold lines
    Step 2: Assemble the main body structure
    Step 3: Attach limbs and head
    Step 4: Add final details and decorative elements

    You are an expert maker. Analyze this image of a craft project: "${userPrompt}".

    🚨 CRITICAL STEP COUNT AND CHARACTER LIMIT RULES 🚨
    - MAXIMUM 4 STEPS TOTAL - This is a hard limit!
    - MAXIMUM 2 CHARACTERS per craft (NOT counting props/accessories)
    - Props and accessories (swords, shields, hats, pots, stands, bases) DO NOT count toward character limit
    - If the project contains more than 2 distinct characters, intelligently select the 2 most important/iconic ones
    - Examples:
      * "Mario and Luigi" = 2 characters ✓ (allowed)
      * "Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser" = 4 characters ✗ (pick 2 most iconic: Mario + Bowser)
      * "Link with Master Sword and Hylian Shield" = 1 character + 2 props ✓ (allowed, props don't count)
      * "Three Piranha Plants in Pots" = 3 characters ✗ (reduce to 2 plants, keep all pots as props)

    STEP COUNT RULES:
    - Do NOT create a "gather materials" or "prepare materials" step - materials list is captured separately
    - Start directly with the first actual construction/assembly step
    - Combine related substeps into single steps (e.g., "Cut and shape base pieces" instead of two steps)
    - Focus on MAJOR construction phases only, not every tiny detail
    - Each step should represent a significant milestone in the build

    WHAT COUNTS AS A CHARACTER vs PROP:
    - Character: Standalone figure, person, creature, or main object (Mario, Link, Piranha Plant, dinosaur)
    - Prop: Accessory, weapon, container, base, or support item (sword, pot, stand, shield, hat, platform)
    - Complex example: "Link figure" = 1 character, "Master Sword" = 1 prop, "Hylian Shield" = 1 prop, "Display base" = 1 prop
    - If unclear, ask: "Can this exist independently as the main focus?" Yes = Character, No = Prop
